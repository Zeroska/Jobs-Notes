# Notes for Jun_27_2022

This is a note or a diary for the things I research in a day, this note intended for me not to forget the knowlegde I has gain (or things I has read).

## What is wermgr.exe

It is legit program signed by Windows, flexible event-based feedback, design to gather information about hardware and sofware problems that Windows can detect
-> If Windows encouter a system crash or a failure -> an error report is generated and stored under WER report queue

under directory C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue) 

But be careful it maybe some malware is camoflare as wermgr.exe, some link <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tale-of-a-windows-error-reporting-zero-day-cve-2019-0863/>

Hacker can use wermgr.exe to **change permission** of some file the CVE is called 2019-0863, it is now patched but don't be a fool, this is a logic bug that reside in Windows
to elevate system privileges
