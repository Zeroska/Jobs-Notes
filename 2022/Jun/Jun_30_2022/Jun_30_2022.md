# Notes for Jun_30_2022

This is a note or a diary for the things I research in a day, this note intended for me not to forget the knowlegde I has gain (or things I has read).

## Malware and Forensic Research

Some tool I found on the internet but haven't put into good use

Good material for the WinAPI Programming link <https://zetcode.com/gui/winapi/system/> it explain very well about WinAPI

## VBA Stomping - Advanced Malware Techniques T1564.007 - Research

**Notes**:
> **A VBA stomped maldoc can only be executed using the same VBA version used to create the document**

VBA Stomping is such a cool technique to use to bypass some AV and Detection, we will discuss some of the concept that related to this technique and some tools

pcodedump link: <https://github.com/bontchev/pcodedmp> mostly the introduction of this notes are come from here, this tool will do analysis on the VBA
macro

### Introduction

It is important that macro written in VBA (the programming language used in MS Office) exist in **three different executable forms**, which can be what
is actually executed at run time, depending on the circumstances

- Source code
   The original source code is compressed and stored at the the end of module stream which can be easy obtain by using oledump or olevba, some case AV
   and those tool can't detect vba script

- P-code (*THE IMPORTANT ONE*)
  As each VBA line entered into the VBA editor, it is immediately compiled into p-code (pseudo code for a stack machine) store different place in the module
  stream -> the **p-code is precisely what is executed most of the time** IN FACT: When you open the source of a macro module in the VBA editor,
  **what is display is not the decompressed source code but a decompiled p-code**

- Execodes
  Their present is not needed or not necessary

### Into to the VBA Stomping technique

The VBA Stomping leverage the behavior of the Source code and the P-code, because when what actually executed is the p-code not the source code itself, **the display is also the decompiled version of the p-code (once the macro is enabled)** -> this is interesting part

-> So the attacker use this knowledge and start craft the payload by altering or just add benign data
