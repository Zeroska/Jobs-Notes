# Notes for Jun_27_2022

This is a note or a diary for the things I research in a day, this note intended for me not to forget the knowlegde I has gain (or things I has read).

## What is wermgr.exe

It is legit program signed by Windows, flexible event-based feedback, design to gather information about hardware and sofware problems that Windows can detect
-> If Windows encouter a system crash or a failure -> an error report is generated and stored under WER report queue

under directory C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue) 

But be careful it maybe **some malware is camoflare as wermgr.exe**, some link <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tale-of-a-windows-error-reporting-zero-day-cve-2019-0863/>

Hacker can use wermgr.exe to **change permission** of some file the CVE is called 2019-0863, it is now patched but don't be a fool, this is a logic bug that reside in Windows
to elevate system privileges

## Linux Forensic - Memory Acquisition

In forensic the first step is to acquire the memory or the evidence that visible and can be obtain easily first (or I would say it is volatile)

### Modern Memory Acquisition

#### Using fmem and LiME

**Fmem** is a software that exports physiscal memory for other program to access, just download it at <http://hysteria.sk/~niekt0/foriana/fmem_curretn.tgz>
**LiME** a tools 

### ELF Files

Learn about ELF file header, understand about it and you will know how malware works

#### GOT (Global Offet Table)

Stores the runtime address of sysmbol that cannot be computed at link time, are often stored within shared libraries that can be loaded anaywhere 
within the process address space

**Using GOT to Locate APIs** because process GOT is typically at a predictable location in memory, exploit code

## Voicebot security

Usually divide into 2 state:

- The data on the transit
- The data on the storage

### How to secure both of these 

The data on transit is quite easy because you have HTTPS and stuffs so the data on the wire is somewhat safe because of encryption 
but the data itself is not because at the other end of the HTTPS call it will be decrypt -> encrypt the data before sending (using
public key, private key exchange) but that isn't enough

The data on the storage on the other hand is quite pretty hard in our case because we don't have control over the voicebot system
