### What is Fileless malware

Fileless malware is the mose dangerouse cyberthreat today. a type of stealth attack that evades detection by most security solutions and impacts forensic analysis

Fileless malware hijack legitimate programs (usually overwrite the return address of a function in a software), it doensn't rely on files -> very hard to detect -> stress the investigator. The attack
is effective because it **run coverly in memory** under the running process (legit process) if the system is rebooted the attack disapper, It take advantage of Powershell and Scripting Language to
Control and access to just about everything and anything on Windows.

Fileless malware gets into the inner recesses of trusted, whitelisted applications (like PowerShell and Windows script host executables such as **wscript.exe** and **cscript.exe**)

## AWS Pushing container to registry

You must authenticate first using this command

```bash
    aws ecr get-login-password --region <regional-zone> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
```

When you get this error:

Error saving credentials: error storing credentials - err: exit status 1, out: `error getting credentials - err: exit status 1, out:`no usernames for 975756108529.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com

-> You should check the credential store first, that mean go to home directory and go to .docker/config.yml and delete the credStore things and you will be fine, work for me but might be not work for you
