# DFIR Process 

Trying to build my own DFIR process | Investigation Process


## Start with Initial Leads

Start with the first evidence you have and start digging into but not always the case you must be flexible and work smart not work hard, if you know that 
the case is within the host then best is to start with the log or the system (EDR) that is has the best context or visiblity

I understand that the good investigator are the one know what is important, and develop a valid leads (just like in the movie) -> you should play around that 
instead of finding useless information 

When Incident happen, the informtaion seem to be everywhere, you got your SIEM, your IPS, your Firewall, your EDR, ... you should determine which Incident 
Type is it and then delploy the countermessure for it
