# Notes for Jun_28_2022

This is a note or a diary for the things I research in a day, this note intended for me not to forget the knowlegde I has gain (or things I has read).

## Emerging Threat of "Black Basta"

Link <https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/cybersecurity-experts-warn-of-emerging.html>
The Black Basta RaaS syndicae has amassed nearly 50 victims in the US, Canada, UK,... all target in the America, the group using **Linux variant** targeting
**ESXi VM**, it is said that Black Basta is to be comprise of **member belonging to the Conti group**

Parent Process: **cmd.exe**
Using ```C:\Windows\System32\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quite```
or  ```C:\Windows\SysNative\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quite```
-> Should be look out for these in the near future

---

## Vssadmin.exe

This will use by the malware to delete Shadow Volume Copies on the Computer

### What is Shadow Volume

Just a backup copy of the original file or folder which is copied even when the file is in use, also known as Volume Snapshot Serivce or simply VSS

## All about the data state

- Data at rest
- Data in transit
- Data in use

People usually care about the first 2 stage -> the voicebot in FPT AI review also like that, in our company we just review just the first 2 stage

## Secure Chatbot and Voicebot

The Principle of Data Protection **should be kept in mind from the momment of conceptualization** till the end of the chatbot, 4 main principle are

- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- Storage limitation
- Integrity and confidentiality

### VoiceBot FPT.Ai Security Aspect

We will boil down to some ground rule of data, in above section data at rest and in transit must be in encryption for safety
-> FPT voicebot give the partner an endpoint which use HTTPS so that fine

> Secure messaging protocols such as HTTPS should be implemented while transferring
data. Further, end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two parties involved in
the conversation have access to the contents of the conversation. Lack of encryption
may leave information susceptible to eavesdropping from an attacker launching a
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM). Often, the chat service provider itself may collect data
being sent via chat services. **Encryption must be implemented for data in transit as
well as data at rest**. Encryption must be implemented using secure encryption
algorithms while maintaining perfect forward secrecy i.e. the compromise of one set
of keys does not enable an attacker to decrypt all previous conversations
